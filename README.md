# Pilot Study on Sampling
Repository for storing materials and data from the pilot study on sampling to accompany ["Sources of Philosophical Intuitions: Towards a Model of Intuition Generation"](https://github.com/DominikDziedzic/IntuitionGenerationProject) project.

This study demonstrates the causal relationship between value- and probability-guided judgments, and responses. David Kaplan’s ‘Carnap vs. Agnew’ case (1978, p. 239) concerning the reference of demonstratives has been converted to experimental materials and presented to participants in one of four conditions.

**The online survey tool used in this study can be accessed here: [On the Use of English Demonstrative "That" (Sampling)](http://kognilab.pl/ls3/index.php/914295?newtest=Y&lang=en).**
